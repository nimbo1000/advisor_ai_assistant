# This project is an AI agent for Financial Advisors integrating Gmail, Google Calendar, and Hubspot.
# The main interface is a ChatGPT-like chat UI.
# Features will include Google OAuth, Hubspot OAuth, RAG, tool calling, memory, and proactive actions.
# Keep structure flexible for future additions: LLM integration, background tasks, webhook/polling handlers, and database models for tasks/memory.
# See project_description.txt for detailed requirements and use cases.
